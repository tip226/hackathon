## (2) Description of your project

The idea behind the design of our project, Flicko, was to merge information about environmental sustainability with an interactive platform. The most effective way to reach a large populus is social media as nowadays ~. Flicko is designed to be a mobile app with aspects of typical social media such as taking and posting photos, captioning, and liking and disliking photos. However, the goal of Flicko is to promote actions that people can do everyday to benefit the environment. The photo taken will be based on a randomized challenge given to all participants (the users). Taking pictures of the challenge’s completion allots the user a certain number of points. Challenges are based on the location type the user tags the photo at: urban, suburban, or rural. Each community has different geography/terrain and will benefit from different actions they can take against climate change. An example challenge would be the “Public Transportation Challenge” which tasks users to take a picture of them on public transportation for the day instead of driving. This would apply to areas of suburban and urban locations as they have more public transportation available and have a larger population using personal and public vehicles. We’re hoping that in the future we can implement a feature such that users are not limited to one photo per challenge in a given time limit.

## (3) The impact that your project makes as it relates to climate change

By encouraging users to take photos of their eco-friendly actions, Flicko not only raises awareness about environmental sustainability but also creates a community of people,  who are actively making a positive impact on the planet. As participants complete challenges and earn points, they can increase their ranking on the app’s leaderboard and gain recognition among the Flicko community. This recognition can help to increase their visibility and influence on the platform and further in the real world, allowing them to inspire others to take action. Through randomized challenges based on location types, Flicko can also provide users with categorized environmental news pertaining to their surroundings through challenges that can practically tackle the issues related to them. The challenges on the Flicko app are designed to encourage small but meaningful actions; these actions might seem small on their own, but when combined with the efforts of others, they can have a significant impact on our planet. We hope that by utilizing the power of social media, Flicko’s approach to promote environmental sustainability will have a positive impact change by encouraging, promoting, sharing a culture of sustainability.
